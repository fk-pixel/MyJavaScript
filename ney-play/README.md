## NEY SCRIPT - A NEY PLAY PROJECT
In this project, as an instrument, we try to recognize sounds through the keys on the keyboard with ney.
The Ney instrument becomes clear in this project with the sound it produces in 21 different tunes.
Running the index.html file together with the sound files included in the project is sufficient for the application to start.
